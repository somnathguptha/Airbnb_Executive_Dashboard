# Airbnb_Executive_Dashboard

The dashboard that I have created is a comprehensive visualization of the Airbnb dataset, aimed at providing insights into various aspects of the business. The dashboard includes eight different visualizations that provide a deep understanding of the dataset, including the most popular neighborhoods for Airbnb hosts, the types of properties listed on Airbnb, the revenue generated every year, and more.

The dashboard is created using Tableau and has been designed to be easily understood by users with varying levels of experience with data analysis. Each visualization is interactive and allows users to drill down to specific data points, providing a more in-depth understanding of the insights being presented.
